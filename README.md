### Approach Taken:

1. Began by modeling the database for User accounts, collections posted by the user, and recommendations listed within each collection. 
2. Started the backend to develop CRUD operations for User accounts, collections, and recommendations.
3. Established authentication for users to have their own user accounts to post collections and recommendations.
4. Developed frontend using React and established communication with the backend. 
5. Work through debugging and merge conflicts
6. CSS styling

### Future Additions to the Site:
- Add navigation buttons such as Back buttons for navigation flow between pages.
- Smoother navigation between buttons, tabs, and pages so that page refreshes when a user, collection or recommendation is added.
